# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This project demonstrates how to extract, process, and visualize stock and revenue data using Python. Using yfinance, I retrieved historical stock prices for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME), and applied web scraping to gather their quarterly revenue data. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations to highlight trends in stock performance and company revenues, enabling actionable insights. All analysis and visualizations are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
